# Newspaper Photobooth Site
A quick and dirty php application for generating newspaper layout 
photos and printing them via email. The newspaper layout is generated
using LaTeX.

It was created by the request of my mother for my grandmother's 
birthday.

It uses the following libraries.

* [PhpMailer][1]
* [Php-Text-Template][2]
* [newspaper.sty][3]

It can be modified however the user sees fit.
