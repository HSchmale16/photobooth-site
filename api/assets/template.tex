\headline{\bf\sf\Large Great Time at Barbara's Party}
    Everyone had a great time at Barbara Collins' Surprise Party. Barbara
    will be 75 soon, and this party
    was for her, and all the struggles of the past year being in the past
    now.
    
    This party
    took place at the Pikeville Sportsman Club. Famous DJ Johnny K was there and a
    photobooth, which allowed guests to create newspapers like the one you
    see right here. The photos were all placed up on a website for all
    guests to access after the party.

    Over 60
    of Grandmom's friends and family attended the party. This
    includes family members who live far away, and they came just for
    this party.
