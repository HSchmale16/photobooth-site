\headline{\bf\sf\Large Great Time at Barbra's Party}
    Everyone had a great time at Barbara Collins Surpise Party. Barbra
    Collins, Deborah Schmale's mother, recently turned 75, and this party
    was for her, and all the struggles of the past year being in the past
    now.
    
    This party
    took place at the Pikeville Sportsman Club. There was a DJ there, and a
    photobooth, which allowed guests to create newspapers like the one you
    see right here. The photos were all placed up on a website for all
    guests to access after the party.

    A lot of Grandmom's friends and family showed up to the party. This
    includes family members who live far away, and they came back just for
    this party.
